### Introduction
The program takes in all the bytecode files (generated by HIPHOP) in a given directory and generates a CFG for each file.

### What Do You Need
1. Bytecode file(s) generated by HIPHOP
2. Graphviz (can be downloaded at http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

### Installation and run
1. Install HIPHOP and Java on your linux box
2. Download the cfg_php.zip
3. Unzip the compressed package and navigate to cfg_php/ 
4. run ./cfg_php.sh $1 
	where $1 is the local path to your php files
5. Your output .dot files will be in the graphviz directory, showing a CFG for every function in your PHP code


#Working php code -> CFG
	This program works correctly for the function.php code found in the test/ directory. You should see two .dot files generated for this php code.  

### How To Run
1. `java -jar CFG_PHP.jar`
2. Enter the directory path of the bytecode file(s)

### What To Expect
* A folder named `Graphviz` created in the source code directory
* A .dot file that has a graphic representation of each CFG.

###More work needs to be done
* Global variables are currently ignored. see the VGetG command in the bytecode specification. The compiled bytecode does not provide an argument for variable position. Not sure about what to do with this.
* PHP custom class definitions are not supported. 
* Working on connecting the seperate CFGs for each function into an interconnected CFG
*We don't currently support the Unwind instruction that passes control to the unwinder
*Unsupported Instructions: Unwind, Throw
