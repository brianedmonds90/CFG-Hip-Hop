### Introduction
The program takes in all the bytecode files (generated by HIPHOP) in a given directory and generates a CFG for each file.

### How To Run
1. Run Main.java in the main package
2. Enter the directory path of the bytecode file(s)

### What To Expect
* In the same directory, a .dot file that has a graphic representation of each CFG.
