### Introduction
The program takes in all the bytecode files (generated by HIPHOP) in a given directory and generates a CFG for each file.

### What Do You Need
1. Bytecode file(s) generated by HIPHOP
2. Graphviz (can be downloaded at http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

### How To Run
1. `java -jar CFG_PHP.jar`
2. Enter the directory path of the bytecode file(s)

### How To Run with Ant
1. CD into source code directory, or where `build.xml` is
2. Run `ant run`
3. Enter directory path of the bytecode file(s)

### What To Expect
* A folder named `Graphviz` created in the source code directory
* A .dot file that has a graphic representation of each CFG.
